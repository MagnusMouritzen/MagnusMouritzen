A YouTube channel made by myself and a friend featuring a handful of tutorials on [Editor Scripting in Unity](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqy--wDEnoVIxVmP_V6RXFg-tc9mVlFgX&si=iGU2nAX2CtD7KK_A) as well as one on [Bit Manipulation](https://youtu.be/gZLhh9uJNAs?si=BP0BRAzJ-4IQciLA).

For all the videos, I planned them, made the code and projects, wrote the audio script, edited the audio, recorded the visuals, and usually also recorded the audio. My friend handled all the video editing and recorded the audio for one of them.

The code for all the [Editor Scripting videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqy--wDEnoVIxVmP_V6RXFg-tc9mVlFgX&si=iGU2nAX2CtD7KK_A) can be found [here](https://github.com/MagnusMouritzen/unity-editor-scripting).
